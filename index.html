    About Me

    Hey, I'm Bob, a passionate football fan hailing from the UK. With a background in Business and Law, I've spent the past 5 years immersing myself in the world of Real Estate, focusing on analysis and data projects. One standout project was creating a Generative Space Design AI within Real Estate. 
    Currently, I'm in the data field within the Finance Sector. Looking ahead, I'm eager to further enhance my skills by pursuing a master's degree in Data and Business Analytics, all while continuing to lead impactful data projects.</p>
